# microswimmers-via-reinforcement-learning

That is a code plotting the path a microswimmer(particle-sized robot) draw while trying to go up in a vortex field. 
Different reinforcement algorithms are applied.


I believe this project is not easy to understand. If you are really interested in Q-learning, reinforcement learning etc. :
